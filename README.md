Title: King of the Hill (KOTH) is a role-playing game (RPG) wherein multiple players embark on a remarkable but gruesome journey as they fight their way to the top of a hill to reign victorious amongst his or her peers. An RPG enables each participant to assume a role or a character, generally, in a fantasy or science fiction setting, that can interact with the game's imaginary world. Players take responsibility for acting out their characters through a process of structured decision-making or character and setting development. In KOTH, players assume three roles: Defender, Runner, and Tanker. Each role is embedded with special skillsets that play to each oneâ€™s advantage or disadvantage over the other.
